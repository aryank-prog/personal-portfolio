                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                
                <p><br><br><br><br><br>Hello! My name is Aryan Kamath and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I hope you enjoy my website and are able to learn a little bit about my life :) <br> <br> I grew up in West Bloomfield, MI and I knew from the beginning that I wanted to be a Michigan Wolverine. Following my graduation from West Bloomfield High School in 2020, I started my freshman year at the University of Michigan. <br> <br> Although I've known since my first semester that I want to study Computer Science, it hasn't always been an easy ride. Studying in such a big school (where CS is a very popular major) can be very intimidating. There were times when I faced imposter syndrome and felt like this major might not be for me. <br> <br> The work experience I've had, organizations I've joined, and the communities I am apart of have helped me foster the confidence to conquer this doubt, allowing for me to discover my passion for Computer Science! Upon my graduation in May of 2024, I hope to work full time as a software engineer. <br> <br> I am currently looking for a software engineering internship in Summer 2023. If you are interested in connecting with me please reach out to me through any of my social media or shoot an email to <b>aryank@umich.edu</b></p>
